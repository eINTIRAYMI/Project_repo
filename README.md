# scout
# this is a project of the designing a drone that floats and flies
# the main idea is to design a drone that uses less energy than the
# actual ones

# the first feature to develop would be a lidar, I thought this scout
# to fly during several hours above a zone mapping it, and storing safely
# all that information inside him as a hard disk.

# another dreamt feature is that having few scouts, this could make a intra-
# net between them. So with a couple of this drones, you will have flying
# servers. Also the data could be encripted and the only way to get it
# would be physically
